# Requirements  
You will need to have the following installed on your computer:

- A GitHub account
- Git
- A text editor
- A web browser


# Installation Guide  
Clone the repository to your local computer.  
     
     $ git clone https://github.com/anujcontractor/routier.git

Change your current directory to the directory of the project repository.

     $ cd <project directory>  

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs  
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    $ npm --version
    

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g

## Front-end  
In a separate terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned project:

    $ cd Routier-frontend  
    
To install the frontend dependencies run the following command

    $ npm install

## Back-end  
To run the backend server we need to install all the dependencies. To do so, we need to navigate to the root folder.

    $ cd ..
    $ npm install 

# Design  
[UI/UX design file](https://www.figma.com/file/7TcXpzmYLJZ0K9aL2BaTMU?type=design)
# Implementation  
# Testing  

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can test the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL:

    http://localhost:<frontend-port>  
    
Replace <frontend-port> with the actual port number of the React frontend server.
